| `columns`                | Lists all column names.                                                      |
| `dtypes`                 | Shows the data type of each column.                                          |
| `info()`                 | Provides detailed information about the dataset, including memory usage.     |
| `value_counts()`         | Counts unique values in a column.                                            |
| `unique()`               | Lists all unique values in a column.                                         |
| `nunique()`              | Displays the total number of unique values in a column.                      |
| `duplicated()`           | Identifies duplicate rows in the dataset.                                    |
| `isnull()`               | Detects missing (null) values in the dataset.                                |
| `dropna()`               | Removes rows with missing values.                                            |
| `isin()`                 | Filters records that match specific elements.                                |
| `str.contains()`         | Filters records containing a specific substring in a column.                 |
| `str.split()`            | Splits strings in a column into multiple columns.                            |
| `to_datetime()`          | Converts a column to datetime format.                                        |
| `dt.year.value_counts()` | Counts occurrences of each year in a datetime column.                        |
| `groupby()`              | Groups data based on specific criteria for aggregation or transformation.    |
| `sns.countplot()`        | Visualizes counts of unique values in a column as a bar graph using Seaborn. |
| `max()`, `min()`         | Calculates the maximum and minimum values of a column.                       |
| `mean()`                 | Calculates the mean (average) value of a column.                             |

### Additional Topics Covered

- Creating new columns
- Filtering data (single and multiple columns) using `and`/`or`

## üîç Tasks and Questions Addressed

### Data Cleaning Tasks:

1. **Check for duplicate records**: Remove duplicates if any.
2. **Check for null values**: Visualize missing data using a heatmap.

### Analytical Questions:

1. **For "House of Cards", what is the Show ID and who is the Director?**
2. **In which year were the highest number of TV Shows & Movies released?** (Visualize with a bar graph)
3. **How many Movies & TV Shows are in the dataset?** (Visualize with a bar graph)
4. **Show all Movies released in the year 2000.**
5. **List the titles of all TV Shows released in India only.**
6. **Identify the Top 10 Directors who contributed the most TV Shows & Movies to Netflix.**
