## üìù Project Description

In this project, a dataset is analyzed to answer specific questions. The solutions are implemented using **Python**, focusing on understanding and working with data using essential commands and techniques. This project helps build a solid foundation in data analysis and manipulation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Commands Used in the Project

Here is a list of key commands and their functions used throughout the analysis:

| **Command**      | **Description**                                                                     |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `head()`         | Displays the first N rows of the data (default: N=5).                               |
| `shape`          | Shows the total number of rows and columns in the dataset.                          |
| `index`          | Provides the index of the dataframe.                                                |
| `columns`        | Displays the names of all columns.                                                  |
| `dtypes`         | Shows the data type of each column.                                                 |
| `unique()`       | Lists all unique values in a specific column.                                       |
| `nunique()`      | Counts the total number of unique values in each column (or in a specific column).  |
| `count`          | Displays the total number of non-null values in each column.                        |
| `value_counts()` | Counts the unique values in a specific column along with their occurrences.         |
| `info()`         | Provides basic information about the dataframe (e.g., data types, non-null counts). |

## üîç Questions Addressed

Below are the questions analyzed and solved using Python:

1. **Find all the unique 'Wind Speed' values in the data.**
2. **Find the number of times when the 'Weather is exactly Clear'.**
3. **Find the number of times when the 'Wind Speed was exactly 4 km/h'.**
4. **Identify all the Null Values in the data.**
5. **Rename the column name 'Weather' to 'Weather Condition'.**
6. **Calculate the mean 'Visibility'.**
7. **Determine the Standard Deviation of 'Pressure'.**
8. **Find the Variance of 'Relative Humidity'.**
9. **Find all instances where 'Snow' was recorded.**
10. **Identify all instances when 'Wind Speed is above 24' and 'Visibility is 25'.**
11. **Compute the Mean value of each column grouped by 'Weather Condition'.**
12. **Determine the Minimum and Maximum values of each column grouped by 'Weather Condition'.**
13. **Display all records where the Weather Condition is 'Fog'.**
14. **Identify all instances where 'Weather is Clear' or 'Visibility is above 40'.**
15. **Find all instances where:**
    - A. 'Weather is Clear' and 'Relative Humidity is greater than 50', OR
    - B. 'Visibility is above 40'.
